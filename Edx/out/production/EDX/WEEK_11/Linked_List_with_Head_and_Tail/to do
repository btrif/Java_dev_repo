Linked List with Head and Tail (non-graded activity)

Read carefully the provided code (all the classes).

We changed the name of the attribute first to head and we added another attribute,
tail. head is a reference to the first node of the linked list,
while tail is a reference to the last node of the linked list.

Implement the missing methods in order to insert at the beginning and at the end,
and to extract from the beginning and from the end.
Remember to update the values of tail and head accordingly.

You can check your code using the provided  main.
