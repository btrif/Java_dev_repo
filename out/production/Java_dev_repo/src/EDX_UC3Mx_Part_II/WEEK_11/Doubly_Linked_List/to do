Doubly Linked List (non-graded activity)

Read carefully the provided code (all the classes).

We changed the class Node, adding an attribute with a reference to the previous node (prev).
The class MyDoublyLinkedList stores as attributes head (a reference to the beginning of the doubly linked list),
and tail (a reference to the end of the doubly linked list).

Implement the missing methods in order to extract from the beginning,
extract from the end and delete all the nodes whose info is identical to the one passed as parameter.
Remember to update the values of tail and head accordingly.

The solution will be published at the end of the week.
Meanwhile, you can discuss your solution at the forum.
