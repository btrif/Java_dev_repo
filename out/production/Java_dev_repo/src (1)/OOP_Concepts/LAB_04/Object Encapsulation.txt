STEP 4: Modeling Characteres. What Do They Have in Common? (Non graded Activity)

In this lab we will see how to model the different characters of our story: on one hand the hero,
who will have to go through the maze, and on the other hand the allies and enemies that he will
find along the way as it seeks its goal.

During the modeling process we will analyze what properties and behaviors have different characters in common,
and which of them are specific to each type of character.
From this information, we will learn how to create an inheritance hierarchy,
and how this mechanism can help us to reduce lines of code and make our programs easier to maintain.
