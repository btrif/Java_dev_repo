            === ABSTRACT CLASSES AND METHODS =====

- A class with at least one abstract method is called "abstract class".
- So an abstract method is a method without the body.

- Constructors, static methods, and final methods cannot be abstract.
- An abstract class is a class where some methods are abstract, and some are not.
- An abstract class is somehow an unfinished class, and we cannot instantiate it into objects.
- An abstract class can be extended to a class, but also to another abstract class.
- You could define a class as abstract  even without having any abstract method. you might want to do this
 to prevent the possibility of instantiating the class.
- However, if there's an abstract method, you will get an error if you don't add the keyword "abstract"
to the class definition
- So abstract methods are useful ways in order not to over-specify.
They help us to delay the definition of the behavior of a method.
- And abstract classes are these unfinished classes that hold abstract methods.

- !!! If a class inherits an ABSTRACT class then it must override all its methods !!!
