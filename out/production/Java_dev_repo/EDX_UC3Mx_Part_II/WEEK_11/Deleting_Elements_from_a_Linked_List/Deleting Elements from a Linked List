Deleting Elements from a Linked List (non-graded activity)

Read carefully the provided code (all the classes).

Implement the code of the method deleteFirstOccurrence(E info),
which deletes in the linked list the first occurrence of the value received as argument.
The method returns a boolean indicating if the operation was succesful.

Implement the code of the method deleteAll(E info), which deletes in the linked list all the occurrences
of the value received as argument. The method returns the number of deleted elements.

Test your code using the main method provided (it is already prepared for testing your new code,
so that you only need to implement the aforementioned two methods).

The solution will be published at the end of the week.
Meanwhile, you can discuss your solution at the forum.
