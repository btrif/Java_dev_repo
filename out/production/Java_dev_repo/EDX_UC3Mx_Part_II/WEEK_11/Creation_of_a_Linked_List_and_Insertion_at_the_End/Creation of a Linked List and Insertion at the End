Creation of a Linked List and Insertion at the End (non-graded activity)

Read carefully the provided code (all the classes).

First of all, create a linked list in the main method (class CreateLinkedList) inserting
several elements at the beginning of the list. Print the list afterwards.

Then, implement a new method called insertEnd(E info) in the class MyLinkedList that inserts elements
at the end of the list. First of all, check if the list is empty.
If so, the first node will be the one created with the information received as argument in insertEnd(E info).
If the list is not empty, you should traverse it until the last node,
appending the node created with the information received as argument in insertEnd(E info).

In order to check if your method is correct,
create another linked list in the main method (class CreateLinkedList) inserting
 several elements at the end of this list. Print this list afterwards.

The solution will be published at the end of the week. Meanwhile,
you can discuss your solution at the forum.
