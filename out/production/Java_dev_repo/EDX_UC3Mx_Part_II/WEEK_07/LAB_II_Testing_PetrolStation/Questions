Testing PetrolStation (non graded activity)

In this laboratory, we will continue working with the FuelTank and Car classes.
In addition, PetrolStation class has been added, which is similar to GasStation class,
but it adds more functionality and simulates the fuel dispenser,
by filling the tank liter by liter, called fuelQuantum.

Using the Codeboard tool below, you must:

1.  Define and add the preconditions and postconditions for the fillEuros(Car car, double amountEuros)
method in the PetrolStation class.

2.  Implement in a new class, e.g. PetrolStationTest,
test cases to cover all paths in the fillEuros(Car car, double amountEuros) method:
- Enter once in the for loop, once for the if conditional part and once for the else part.
- Enter once in the for loop and else conditional part.

3.  Program the JUnit Test Case class for the Car class, CarTest.java, to test all class's methods.
4.  Program the integration testing, in which the car travels, but it does not have enough fuel.
So the tank must be filled. Print the amount of euros that the customer spends.
